# BankAnalysis
analysis for a financial institution on customer segmentation and deposit detection system for a financial organization

# Introduction
This analysis was carried out using Python and the data was imported as a csv file. Null values were checked for and the data was cleaned. New features were also created using the existing dataset.

# Insights
Before getting the insights, what are the problems we'll like to evaluate and proffer solutions to?
- Identify patterns and trends in customers behaviours
- How effective have the campaigns being?
- Analyze loan trends and marketing campaign effectiveness
- Analysis on optimizing operations and mitigating risks/loan defaults
- How to improve customer deposits
- Anticipate future customer behaviour and likelihood of customers deposits

The insights gotten from the dataset are;
- The highest number of customers are adults i.e between the age of 30 and 40
- It can be noticed that May had the highest encounter with customers however, January had the highest number of deposits.
- It was also noticed that over 70% of the customers have not acquired any loan and further analysis showed that even those with loans have very low default rate
- Those without housing loan have higher account balance in the bank which makes sense because mortgage would keep taking a portion of their earnings. Marital status does not influence this conclusion
- Analysing account balance, it was noticed that those with blue collar and management jobs have higher account balance and those with housemaid jobs or students have lesser account balance. The inference is that this is dependent on how much you earn.
- Looking into deposits, only 11.7% of customers have deposits in the bank and about 88.3% do not. This is really low for revenue generation
- When it comes to market campaign, over 81% of the previous campaigns have unknown outcomes. However, the rate of failure is higher than that of success and this was attributed to the fact that the period between the previous campaign and the current campaign was long. 
- It can be noticed that the major means of communication of campaigns was through a cell or a telephone. 

# Recommendation
- To increase deposits, interest rate can be increased, zero withdrawal rate can be implemented via online or mobile banking, little or no money transfer rates can be implemented. This would persuade customers to deposit their money much more in the bank.
- Customers constantly need reminders and convincing on the benefit of a product before purchase so implementing a lesser timeframe between campaigns could be more effective.
- Social media platforms should be utilized, these are usually cheaper especially with organic engagement of posts and referrals. Then broadcast and Radio stations could be used as the age range of majority of the customers are adults, they are more inclined towards the TV stations and still listen to radio channels.
